Write a Query to Determine Which Instances Have High CPU Utilization
Access the Prometheus expression browser in your web browser:

http://<PROMETHEUS_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>:9090
Run a query to add the CPU usage in the system and user modes for each instance. Then, filter the results to only instances where the combined number of CPU seconds is more than 10000:

(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="system"} + ignoring(mode) node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"}) > 10000
Log in to the Prometheus server and open the output file:

vi /home/cloud_user/report.md

{cpu="0",instance="limedrop-web:4455",job="limedrop_web"}	38131.66
{cpu="0",instance="limedrop-auth:4455",job="limedrop_auth"}	38131.66



Get the Per-Second Rate of Increase in HTTP Request Duration for All Instances
Run a query from the Prometheus expression browser:

rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m])
Copy the output, including the element data and values.
{instance="limedrop-web:4455",job="limedrop_web"}	0.028511925925925923
{instance="limedrop-auth:4455",job="limedrop_auth"}	0.031154449425905166


On the Prometheus server, open the output file in a terminal:

vi /home/cloud_user/report.md
Paste in the data obtained using the query at the end of the file.
